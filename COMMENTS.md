	◦	Main architecture decisions you've made and a quick explanation of why.
-I just tried to make use of react hooks
	◦	List of third party libraries and why you chose each one.
vite react template:
just to have base template with scaffoleded components.
axios-hooks: 
To have a simple way to fetch data through HTTP following the usage of hooks.
react-bootstrap:
I brought this into the solution just to reuse its modal component (but I made usage of some others too).
	◦	What in your code could be improved if you had more time.
-I'd like to have spent more time looking into some other architecture examples on how to use react hooks.
-Create a separate component for the usage of modals.
